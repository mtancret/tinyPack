Description

This is a library of data compression algorithms for TinyOS. These algorithms
can compress arrays of up to 256 bytes at a time. The main design criteria is
that they use no more than a few hundred bytes of RAM. This is required because
many microprocessors used for sensor networks have only a few kilobytes of RAM
total. The most popular compression algorithms used today, typically require
several kilobytes of RAM to achieve useful compression, making them unsuitable.

The code is still in the experimental stages. So far we have implementations
of two LZSS-like compression algorithms and an even more experimental
Exponential Golomb Code based compression algorithm.

Targeting TinyOS 2.x.
